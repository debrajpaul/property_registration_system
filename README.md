## property_registration_system

     Blockchain is an immutable distributed ledger that is shared with everyone present on a network. Each participant interacts with the blockchain using a publicâ€“      private cryptographic key combination. Moreover, the records stored on the blockchain are immutable, making them very hard to tamper with. This provides better      security. A solution such as Hyperledger Fabric also offers the features to maintain users and roles, which additionally help secure and identify owners. .
